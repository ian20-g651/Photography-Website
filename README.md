Femme Fashion


Welcome to Femme Fashion, a dazzling portfolio site that celebrates queer, girlie, and unapologetically bold style. This project was created as part of a Moringa School assignment, and it brings together creativity, individuality, and clean code.



Overview
This site showcases four iconic fashion archetypes:

Pastel Princess – bright, bubbly, and full of sass

Red Carpet Riot – glam, elegant, and ready to slay

Queer Royalty – gender-bending excellence in every stitch

Goth Barbie – dark, romantic, and fashion-forward

Each look is represented by a card with a styled image and caption, all wrapped in a custom-designed interface.



Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure of the site

CSS3 – Custom styling for every fierce element

Flexbox & Responsive Design – Layout magic across screen sizes
